# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# What is `npm`?

`npm` stands for Node Package Manager. It is a package manager for JavaScript and the default package manager for Node.js. `npm` allows developers to:

- Install and manage packages (libraries and tools) from the npm registry.
- Create and publish their own packages to the npm registry.
- Manage project dependencies through a `package.json` file.

# What is `npx`?

`npx` stands for Node Package Execute. It is a tool that comes with npm (starting from version 5.2.0) and allows you to execute packages directly from the npm registry without having to install them globally. This can be useful for running one-off commands or tools that you donâ€™t want to install permanently on your system.

**Key Differences between `npm` and `npx`:**

- **npm** is primarily used for managing packages and project dependencies.
- **npx** is used for running packages or tools without the need to install them globally.

# What is `yarn`?

`yarn` is another package manager for JavaScript, created by Facebook in collaboration with other companies. It was developed as an alternative to `npm` and aims to solve some of the performance and reliability issues that developers faced with `npm` in its earlier versions.

**Key Differences between `npm` and `yarn`:**

- **Speed**: `yarn` is generally faster than `npm` due to its efficient caching and parallel installation processes.
- **Dependency Resolution**: `yarn` has a deterministic dependency resolution, meaning the same dependencies are installed in the same way every time, which ensures consistency across different environments.
- **Lock Files**: Both `npm` (with `package-lock.json`) and `yarn` (with `yarn.lock`) use lock files to ensure consistent installations, but the format and handling of these files can differ.
- **Offline Mode**: `yarn` has a built-in offline mode, allowing you to install packages without an internet connection if they've been previously downloaded.
- **Command Syntax**: Some commands differ between `npm` and `yarn`, although many are similar or identical.

# Summary

- **npm**: Package manager for installing and managing Node.js packages.
- **npx**: Tool for executing packages without installing them globally.
- **yarn**: Alternative package manager to `npm`, offering faster performance and more reliable dependency management.
